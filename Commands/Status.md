# git status

The command `git status` is extremely helpful when it comes to checking on the, you guessed it, **status** of your repo.

Using `git status` will showyou what changes are being tracked, aren't being tracked, what commits need to be pushed/pulled, etc. It's exactly what it sounds like.

Statues is a command that is safe to use at any time. If you want to tsee what is going on it's good to use `git status` in between commands until you get to know the flow better.

```
git add .
git status

git commit -m"changed header size"
git status

git push
git status
```
