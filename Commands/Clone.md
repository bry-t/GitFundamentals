# git clone

Cloning a repo is the act of creating a new directory and an associated copy of the remote repo. It will be a clone, meaning that it has all tracked commits and commit history.

It will also be associated with the remote, meaning that you can use the `git pull` command to pull updates from the original repo.

It can be done with the `git clone` command as seen here:
```
git clone https://github.com/ElevenFiftyAcademy/TerminalDungeon.git
```
